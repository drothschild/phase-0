### What does puts do?
> Puts returns nil and prints the output in to the console on a new line(I could rephrase it from the challenge text, but it's really put best there.)

### What is an integer and what is a float?
> An integer is a number without a decimal point. A float is a number with a decimal point

### What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
> Integer division returns the result of division without the exact decimal point answer. In other words, similar to grade school math where you would have a whole number and a remainder, except it's a different function to return the remainder.

```ruby
puts 365*24*60
```

```ruby
puts (10*365+2)*24*60
```

### How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
>Very well. (This isn't a smart-ass answer, or at least it isn't just one. It handles basic math exactly as you'd expect with no surprises.)

### What is the difference between integers and floats?
>Integers are numbers without decimal points. Floats are numbers with decimal points.

### What is the difference between integer and float division?
Integer division returns the result of division without the exact decimal point answer, with the possibility of solving for a remainder. Float division returns the exact decimal point result of division, with no remainder.

### What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
> Strings are arrays of letters. You would use them anytime you want to represent words or letters in programming.

### What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
>Local Variables are pointers to values, but only accessable in the local scope. You'd use them throughout programming to represent anything.

### How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
>It was fine. I was worried about how much I had forgotten, but it generally flowed back to me.
