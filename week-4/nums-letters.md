### What does puts do?
> Puts returns nil and prints the output in to the console on a new line(I could rephrase it from the challenge text, but it's really put best there.)

### What is an integer and what is a float?
> An integer is a number without a decimal point. A float is a number with a decimal point

### What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
> Integer division returns the result of division without the exact decimal point answer. In other words, similar to grade school math where you would have a whole number and a remainder, except it's a different function to return the remainder.

```ruby
puts 365*24*60
```

```ruby
puts (10*365+2)*24*60
```
