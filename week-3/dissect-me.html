    <p><h2>Blog Entry</h2>
      When I was young and starting out with programming, I made changes without version controlling. Someone asked for a new feature in a database/interface, and I added it without thinking twice, or maybe even once. Also the software I was using had no support for versioning. Because of this, I'd frequently wake up to hear that everything had crashed. If I'd had version control, I could have rolled back the changes without having to grab a backup tape from the day before. In addition, if I'd kept logs of my changes I'd have known what to undo. And my team(if I'd had one) could have reviewed my code(if the project existed in code, rather than scripting modules and GUI interfaces) and tested it themselves.

<!-- Reflect
• What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

I used header and article in this challenge, and a lot last week. Article seems the best for most text blocks and Header seems invaluable for organizing data at the top of the page.

•How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

The browser uses the nesting and outline to lay out elements on a page. Or at least it will once we do some CSS.

• What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

Sublime has some powerful snippets. It's also got some powerful tools that I don't know if I want to screw with. I will probably look up those sublime manuals that keep being reccomended to us. I'd look up the existing snippets if there was a user friendly
way to see them all.
