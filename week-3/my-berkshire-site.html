<!--
* What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file?

You need to know the relative directory location of the stylesheet. In some cases, you need to know how to go up a directory (../), and how to structure absolutely

* What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it?

It was very hard to get the table of links to display as I wanted. I think I still didn't get a CSS table absolutely as I wanted it to.
* What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)

color:, text-align:, font-size, (In pixels),font-weight (it was difficult to realize that font-style did not bold the text)
* Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?

I created ids for the "links" , for the "ad", and "link-text"- to change the text size of text next to links. In addition, I choose  "large-caps"- for the first letters in "Berkshire Hathaway"
* When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?
I thought mine was cleaner, particularly in table. A lot of formatting code was repeated over, obscuring the text.

Also, we used more white space.
