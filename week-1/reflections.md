#1.1 Think About Time Reflection
In the frequent absence of actual productivity, I have had an addiction to productivity texts. I have a Pomodoro running (one of, I discovered, two apps I installed.) I have Omnifocus( a GTD organizer), a Labelmaker, and several other tools. And yet I'm not actually very productive. I have a million personal tabs open right now. I probably wouldn't be working well today if I didn't constantly remind myself: "Don't screw up day one," which I see in none of the the links I researched today. In fact, I know it won't work in the long term and neither will my current time management strategy of waiting until the last minute to work. I wanted to learn more about Flow and read some of Mihály Csíkszentmihályi's book "Finding Flow," but found the advice of essentially viewing every task like athletic practice in efficiency not terribly useful. Timeboxing, which is the  idea of setting a specific period of time in which to work, rather than grinding away until a goal is met, has worked for me when I haven't found flow in work. At the same time, I'm worried I will end  I do know meditation has been useful when I've tried it, and the Pomadoro technique is simple enough to do, and has been effective this morning. So I'm going to try the following:

Meditate first thing in the morning, initially for 10 minutes, with the goal of increasing it to 20 when I feel comfortable with 10.

Work on the Pomodoro technique of 4 sessions of 25 minutes, with 5 minute breaks in between and a long break at the end.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
1. What is a shell? What is "bash?"
Shell is the user interface for a computer. Bash is the most commonly used (on unix) command line interface.

2. What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?

Typos. Also stopping and starting the video because I thought I missed something

3. Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?

Yes.

4. I'll be cliche and say man is the most useful

5.

- pwd Print Working Directory

- ls list contents of directory

- mv move file

- cd change directory

- ../ indicates the directory containing the current directory

- touch make a new file

- mkdir make a new directory

- less show file contents screen by screen.

- rmdir remove directory (won't work if the directory contains files or directories)

- rm remove file

- help I don't believe we used the help command, just the man command.

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
Creating a new repository: log on to Github, go to your profile, and pull down the plus signal menu on the upper right hand side. Click New repository. Give it a name, select the options and licensing you want, and click create

To fork an existing Github repository, go to it and click fork on the right hand side of the screen. Select whether you want to clone it as yourself or as an organization. Click Ok.

To clone a repo, first copy its clone url from the middle right hand side of the screen. Then go to your terminal, navigate to the folder you want to clone it to, and type "git clone " and then your copied url. You may have to enter your github password.

Forking a repository is essential to collaboration. You need to fork so that you can work on an existing project, and possibly send your contributions back to the main project.
