* Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

drothschild.github.io

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

To create a repository, log in to your Github account in your web browser. You'll find a plus button on the upper right hand side of the screen. Press that and click "New Repository". From there, chose a name and license for your repository.

To clone it, go to the right hand side of your web browser and find the HTTPS clone URL. Copy the url and go to your terminal. Using the terminal, navigate to the folder you want to use. Type "git clone " and then paste the URL, and it will download the repository to your directory.

* Describe what open source means.

Open source is software whose source code is available to anyone to look at and use, provided they follow the licenses provided.

* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I don't believe in tech based utopias, but I like Open Source, and don't feel nervous about it. Well ok, I imagine myself writing sloppy code or grammar errors and other people seeing it. But almost everything fundamental to the internet depends on it.


* Assess the importance of using licenses.

Without licenses, the rules of open source wouldn't neccessarily be followed. For those who want more restrictive use of software, such as commercial or copy-left open source software, licenses wouldn't be enforceable at all.

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

I find the routine of working with git soldified in this challenge. I still have to look up what the commands are, but I get the workflow, and why it works.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
